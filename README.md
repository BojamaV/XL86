# XL86
XL86 is a small computing language that can preform simple and various tasks

# Installation
requirements: Python3

install here: https://www.python.org/

git clone https://github.com/BojamaV/XL86.git

cd XL86

# cmds/run
python3 shell.py (This is the compiler for XL86)

python3 help.py (Instructions/Guide for XL86)

I dont really want to add much i might add the run option where you can execute files of the XL86 code on the shell but that will be only for the repl unless you make something work locally i assume.

enjoy!


# Language

the syntax for XL86 is required to be exact, everything is formatted in ALL CAPS

print: PRINT("hello world")

strings: "hello world" outputs as "example text"

math: x, /, +, -

# IF, THEN, ELSE

this part is very simple, the IF statement represents true/false values for instance IF 5 == 6 THEN PRINT("Hello world") of course this isnt a true statement so that is when we deploy the ELSE statement the complete code would look like this: IF 5 == 6 THEN PRINT("Hello world") ELSE PRINT("5 is not the same as 6")
